      "What I learned in the chapter 1 is that we need to know about the characteristics of a data structure. There are three characteristics which is the correctness, time complexity, and space complexity. Knowing this three would guide us into making a good structure of data. I have learned also that there are cases too in execution time which are worst case, average case and best case and a good execution time is the best case. Why is it important to learn data structures? There are three common problems that applications face nowadays that we need to know for us to improve. These three problems are data search, processor speed, and multiple request. In order to avoid this three problems, data should be structured in an arranged or organized way so that when we search a data, the data will instantly be found not including those that are not required. There are applications of data structure and algorithms which are search, sort, insert, update, and delete which are easy to understand. There are also basic terminologies that we yet to be familiarize because they are important. Lastly, the algorithm which is a step-by-step process. It should be unambiguous which means be clear and the input and outputs should be well defined, and it should also be finite. Should be feasible too that other languages can also use the made algorithm\n"

      "In chapter 3 we tackled about arrays. Array is important when we have a lot of data, but why is it important? First let’s know what arrays are. Arrays are containers which can store fixed number of data’s that are the same so if we have a lot of data, we can just use array to make the code shorter and easier. In an array there is an element which is the item stored and index is the location of an item. In an array we can use the basic operations which are the traverse, insertion, deletion, search, and update. Anyways update is just like replacing one item from the list. Typecode are the codes that is used to define the type of value to store in the array. We use “from array import*” and then the list or the array below which is “arrayname= array(‘typecode’,[ list of values]) and then next line is “for x in arrayname :” and then “print(x)”. Here are the following codes to use for each operation, insertion : arrayname.insert() ; deletion : arrayname.remove(); update : arrayname(index) = value.\n"

Built-in data types are data types that is in language already. These are the integers, boolean, floating, and character and strings. Integers are defined as the whole numbers, a negative, or positive numbers and most definitely not a fraction. Boolean determines if the value is true or false. True and false can be 1 represents true and 0 represents false. Floating is the decimals. Character and strings are the characters put in a single quote. Derived data type are data types are implemented. These are list, array, stack, and queue. We tackled the basic operators which are the traversing for moving from one place to another, searching for search, insertion for insert, deletion for delete, sorting for sort, and merging for merging.\")"
